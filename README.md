Currently thinking about possible test scenarios

### Actual Implementation

If the Phase 1 analysis of the report in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bs38PMkIK1B6EcN0l4knN2lFnWhiU4hVGH9SBK0zUMU/edit?usp=sharing) be positive about assimp  integration then this part will be compilation process for the assimp library for specific usecases.
