# Assimp Analysis

This repository includes code analysis of the
assimp library.


## Plan

Three step plan is going to be used for the analysis.

### Initial setup [Done]

This part includes the initial setup of the assimp library and reading/rendering one basic file.

### Writing a converter from assimp to gazebo for Gltf2 

This part related to integration process of assimp to the Gazebo's source code.

Writing a simple converter will help me to deepen my analysis on phase 1.


### Actual Implementation

If the Phase 1 analysis of the report in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bs38PMkIK1B6EcN0l4knN2lFnWhiU4hVGH9SBK0zUMU/edit?usp=sharing) be positive about assimp  integration then this part will be compilation process for the assimp library for specific usecases.
