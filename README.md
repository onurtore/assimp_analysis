# Assimp Analysis

This repository includes code analysis of the
assimp library.


## Plan

Three step plan is going to be used for the analysis.

### Initial setup [Done]

This part includes the initial setup of the assimp library and reading/rendering one basic file.

### Testing

This part related to test scenarios for the assimp library for possible integration to the Gazebo's source code and actually implementing them.

Currently thinking about possible test scenarios

### Actual Implementation

If the Phase 1 analysis of the report in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bs38PMkIK1B6EcN0l4knN2lFnWhiU4hVGH9SBK0zUMU/edit?usp=sharing) be positive about assimp  integration then this part will be compilation process for the assimp library for specific usecases.  


## Contributing

Step two is little bit cloudy and requires different idea.
