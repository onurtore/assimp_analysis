# Building Assimp

You can use the link [here](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/Build.md) Be aware that not all the parts of the assimp is required for the Phase 2.

This reporsitory uses release 5.1.1 of the assimp. Final release (5.2.3) gives compilation errors on fresh Ubuntu 20.04. 

This is very important aspect of using external library for a task, but how we can use this info to decide whether use assimp or not?
